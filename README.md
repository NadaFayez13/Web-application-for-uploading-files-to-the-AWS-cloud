# CLOUDY FILES

This project is a cloud-based web application that allows users to securely upload and access their files at any time. Once a file is uploaded through the user interface, it is automatically classified and stored in **Amazon S3**, with download links generated on the spotâ€”making the process smooth, fast, and efficient.
The backend is built using **Flask**, and integrates with AWS services such as **EC2** for **24/7** hosting, and **S3** for scalable, secure storage. File handling and AWS operations are powered by the boto3 SDK, and the frontend is designed to support common file formats like **PDF**, **JPG**, **PNG**, and **TXT**.


## **Cloud Infrastructure**
### **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
We created a fully isolated VPC to serve as the secure network layer of the application. It includes private IP address management, DNS support, and custom route tables to control inbound and outbound traffic. This ensures a tightly secured and performance-optimized environment.
